The BioImage Model Zoo and the corresponding model metadata specification has been established by the authors of [the reference paper](https://bioimage.io/docs/#/?id=reference-publication). The project continues to be under active development; community partners meet weekly to discuss immediate issues, short-, medium- and long-term plans. Decisions on community partner memberships, changes to the model specifications or website design and developments are made in the weekly meeting if at least 5 (five) participants are present. All decisions are made public in the meeting minutes [currently hosted here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage.io/issues/28) and take effect after 15 days unless other members raise concerns at the next weekly meetings. The Steering Board of the AI4Life project [listed here](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/about-us/) maintains veto power on all decisions, including changes to the above-described procedure.
