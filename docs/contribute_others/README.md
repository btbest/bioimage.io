# BioImage.IO Datasets and Applications

The BioImage Model Zoo establishes a common dissemination point for deep learning trained models in the bioimage analysis community. To enable further processing, more complex workflows, fine-tuning or retraining, it is possible to contribute software applications (e.g., python notebooks) or documented datasets.
Please, check the generic Resource Description File for [notebook and datasets contribution](https://bioimage.io/docs/#/contribute_models/README?id=contributing-other-resource-types).

## Datasets
The BioImage Model Zoo does not necessarily store data. Instead, it displays information about publicly available data that was or can be used to train a model. The information will also be displayed with a card in the web page. Datasets are usually linked to models already published in the BioImage Model Zoo.

## Applications
Software applications such as notebooks, python scripts or ImageJ macros can also be provided through the BioImage Model Zoo. These applications are usually linked to a model in the zoo.
